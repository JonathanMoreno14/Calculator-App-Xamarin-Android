# Calculator-App-Xamarin-Android

This is a Calculator application created using C#, Xamarin, and Visual Studio. 

The application computes basic arithmetic that consist of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus arithmetic.

###Getting Started

To get started with the mobile application you can clone or download the Zip file. ***Please note Xamarin Platform uses C# for the application development*** This [Link](https://github.com/JonathanMoreno14/Programming-Languages-Concepts/blob/master/C_Sharp/c_sharp.md) is another repository that contains the basics of Object Oriented Programming in C# to get you started


```sh
  $ git clone  https://github.com/JonathanMoreno14/Calculator-App-Xamarin-Android.git

```

####How to Use

Once the repository has been downloaded you can use [Xamarin Studio](https://xamarin.com/studio) or [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx). Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition contains Xamarin Starter Edition that is **Free** to use. Although it is free there are some limitations, you can create, build, and publish applications using Xamarin Starter Edition, as I found out you are limited with basics features. You are not allowed to use Libraries from [Xamarin Components](https://components.xamarin.com/) References. 

[Build Limitations](https://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/2912/xamarin-starter-edition-build-limits)


####For Windows and Mac OSX users

You must download [Xamarin](https://xamarin.com/download) for your machine in order to utilize the platforms capabilities. 

####Android Emulator

Similar to Andriod Studio and Eclipse, Xamarin has a version of an [Android Emulator](https://xamarin.com/android-player) that you can utilize for your development. 




##Addendum
####Computations
Computations for this basic calculator application are simplistic that they can be done with other object-oriented programming languages.

The computation consist of the user input in a form of a string the input is then converted to a specific (Data Type)[] most if not all object-oriented programming languages have these specific data types **double**, **int**, **long** ...etc each programming language has special methods for converting integers and strings ; vice versa. Once the strings have been been converted to the specific data type then you can compute the numbers and finally depending on the result you can converted back to string
